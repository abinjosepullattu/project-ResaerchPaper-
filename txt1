Classifying waste using IoT without relying on deep learning involves utilizing various sensors and rule-based algorithms. Here are steps and techniques to achieve waste classification:

### Sensors and Hardware Components
1. **Weight Sensors:**
   - Measure the weight of the waste to estimate the type of waste based on its density.

2. **Color Sensors:**
   - Detect the color of the waste to distinguish between recyclables like plastics, metals, and paper.

3. **Gas Sensors:**
   - Identify specific gases emitted by certain types of waste, like organic waste emitting methane.

4. **Moisture Sensors:**
   - Measure the moisture content, which can help differentiate between organic (wet) and inorganic (dry) waste.

5. **Proximity/Ultrasonic Sensors:**
   - Used to detect the presence and distance of objects in the waste bin.

6. **RFID/NFC Tags:**
   - Tags can be used on waste items to classify them automatically when placed in the bin.

### Data Processing and Rule-Based Algorithms

1. **Weight and Density Analysis:**
   - Calculate the density of the waste (weight/volume). For example:
     - High density might indicate metals or glass.
     - Low density might indicate plastics or paper.

2. **Color Analysis:**
   - Use a color sensor to detect the predominant color of the waste:
     - Green or brown could indicate organic waste.
     - Bright colors could indicate plastics.

3. **Gas Emission Detection:**
   - Monitor gases like methane (CH₄) for organic waste or ammonia (NH₃) for certain chemicals:
     - Presence of methane might indicate organic waste.
     - Presence of other specific gases can indicate different types of waste.

4. **Moisture Content Measurement:**
   - High moisture content is often associated with organic waste.
   - Low moisture content might indicate paper, plastics, or metals.

5. **RFID/NFC Tag Identification:**
   - Use RFID/NFC tags on waste items that can be scanned to identify the type of waste:
     - Tagged items can provide precise classification data.

### System Workflow

1. **Waste Detection:**
   - As waste is deposited into the bin, sensors collect data on weight, color, gas emissions, and moisture content.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - The microcontroller processes sensor data using predefined rules to classify the waste. Example rules:
     - If weight/volume ratio > specific threshold, classify as metal or glass.
     - If color sensor detects green/brown, classify as organic.
     - If methane detected, classify as organic.

3. **Waste Classification:**
   - Based on sensor data and rules, classify the waste and store the classification result.

4. **Data Transmission:**
   - Transmit the classification data to the cloud for monitoring and further analysis.

5. **User Feedback:**
   - Provide immediate feedback to users via a display or mobile app, indicating the classification result and providing disposal guidance.

### Example Rule-Based Algorithm

```python
def classify_waste(weight, volume, color, gas, moisture):
    density = weight / volume
    
    if density > 5:
        return "Metal/Glass"
    
    if color in ["green", "brown"]:
        if gas == "methane":
            return "Organic"
        if moisture > 60:
            return "Organic"
        return "Inorganic"
    
    if color in ["white", "blue", "yellow"]:
        return "Plastic"
    
    if moisture < 20:
        return "Paper"
    
    return "Unknown"
```

### Additional Considerations

1. **Calibration and Maintenance:**
   - Regular calibration of sensors is necessary to maintain accuracy.
   - Periodic maintenance to ensure all components function correctly.

2. **Integration with Existing Systems:**
   - Ensure compatibility and integration with existing waste management and recycling systems.

3. **User Training and Awareness:**
   - Educate users on how to properly dispose of waste and use RFID/NFC tags where applicable.

By leveraging a combination of sensors and rule-based algorithms, you can effectively classify waste in a smart bin management system without relying on deep learning techniques.
